Steps to use the application :
* The home page gives option to either login as a user or admin.
* For admin login, "admin" is the username and "pass" is the password.
* Then, we can see all the data entered by other users in a tabular form. We can also see two buttons which show graphs ,showing educational levels and languages known by the users. These graphs will change as we enter more and more data.
* For user login, we have a password-less login, where we can login through Gmail Account.
* Once we login, we can submit a form by clicking on "Fill Survey" button. And we can Logout once we are done.
