Steps to use the application :
* The home page gives option to either login as a user or admin.
* For admin login, "admin" is the username and "pass" is the password.
* Then, I can see all the data entered by other users in a tabular form. I can also see two buttons which show graphs ,showing educational levels and languages known by the users. These graphs will change as I enter more and more data.
* For user login, I have a password-less login, where I can login through Gmail Account.
* Once I login, I can submit a form by clicking on "Fill Survey" button. And I can Logout once I am done.

### Assumptions
* I have assumed that there is no need to store email ids with which a user logs in, since one user can submit multiple surveys.
* Admin can only see the dashboard after logging in and the credentials are stored in database. There is only one admin for the application.
